# Weather-Journal App Project

# Overview
This project was about working with Web APIs and asynchronous code, creating a web app that uses OpenWeatherMap API to get weather based on user's location, and dynamically update UI.

# Node and Express Environemnt
In this project we are using Node and Express environemnts. Node and Express should be installed on the local machine. The project file server.js should require express(), and should create an instance of their app using express.

# How i built the app
To get the project up and running I followed these steps:

1- i installed the Cors and body-praser packages in server.js
2- i added POST and GET routes to ensure correct retrieval of data from the server.
3- i got my API key  from OpenWeatherMap website.
4- i Created async functions to fetch weather data and store it on my local server.
5- i added function that updates UI dynamically.

# What I used:
